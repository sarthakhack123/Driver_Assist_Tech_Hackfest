## _"A Safety System for avoiding two wheeler accidents"_

The aim of the project is to design and develop a Rider-Assist Technology which can prevent the two-wheeled vehicle from tilting beyond a safe inclination. This can save the vehicle from falling eventually saving the rider from casualties.

The MPU-6050 sensor is used which provides the inclination data of the vehicle. This data is processed by the micro computer which uses filtering algorithms and PID controller algorithms to generate the required restoring torque on the system

Hardware Components required:
- Arduino-UNO MPU6050
- L298N motor driver
- BO Motor 60rpm,
- High torque DC geared motor,
- LiPo Battery,
- SG90 Micro-Servo motor
